<h1>How does Pets To You work?</h1>

<p style="color: orange;">First you select an animal you like, we have all sorts of pets to choose from. We have cats, dogs, reptiles, birds, cows, horses, and fish. Once you choose which one you want you put in payment information and an address for delivery. In a few days' time, your brand-new pet will be delivered straight to your doorstep.<p>

<h1>Quality guarantee.</h1>

<p style="color: green;">We are committed to bringing the best possible experience to all of our users so if for any reason you have a complaint or problem with our service, we will fix it to the best of our ability. For example, if any pet dies in transit we will send a new one as well as a 15% discount on your next purchase of any pet from Pets to You.</p>
